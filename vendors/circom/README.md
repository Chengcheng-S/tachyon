1. Speed: Tachyon runs approximately 10 times faster than Rapidsnark! The [benchmark](/vendors/circom/benchmark/README.md) was conducted using sha256_512.circom with a degree of 2ยนโถ.
2. Seamless Workflow: Tachyon doesn't require you to run any additional programs just to generate a circom proof. No need for snarkjs for witness file generation.
3. Flexible Witness Handling: With Tachyon, you can modify the witness directly in your program. No need to create a separate JSON file with snarkjs.
4. Integrated Build System: Tachyon seamlessly integrates circom compilation into the build system, specifically bazel. When you make changes to a circom file, it's compiled accordingly and built in parallel, ensuring a safe and efficient process.
5. Field Support: Tachyon isn't limited to bn128; it easily supports all fields!
